# kivy-News-App
 
This is a Python application that utilizes the Kivy framework to create a simple news reader app. The app fetches the latest science-related top stories from the New York Times API and displays them in a scrollable interface. Each news article is presented with its title, abstract, and an image (if available). Users can click on the source link to open the full article in a web browser.

Features:

1. Fetching Data: The app uses the requests library to fetch data from the New York Times API's "Top Science Stories" section.

2. Parsing Data: The fetched JSON data is parsed to extract relevant information like title, abstract, publication date, URL, and multimedia            (images).

3. Kivy Interface: The app uses the Kivy framework to create a graphical user interface. It consists of a scrollable view that displays each news article with its title, abstract, and an image (if available). Users can click on a source link to open the full article in a web browser.

4. Dynamic Layout: The Kivy interface dynamically adjusts to accommodate the number of news articles fetched from the API.

5. Image Handling: The app attempts to display an image associated with each article. If no image is available, a default "No Image" placeholder is shown.

6. Source Link: Each article is accompanied by a source link that users can click to open the full article in a web browser.


Possible Improvements:

1. Caching: Implementing caching mechanisms to avoid unnecessary API requests and improve app performance. This would be especially useful when users scroll back and forth through articles, and improve the user experience of the app at startup.

2. GUI: Improving the user interface of the app and providing more news options.
